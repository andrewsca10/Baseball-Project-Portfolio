The rulebook for baseball is extensive, with plenty of nuances and edge cases. For the purposes of these notebooks, however, these simplified rules and definitions will be sufficient for those unfamiliar.

The fundamental unit of baseball events is the plate appearance (PA), comprising a batter standing at home plate (in areas called “batter’s boxes”) and a pitcher on the pitching mound, as well as a catcher behind home plate and defenders in the field. The batter’s objective is to reach first (1B), second (2B), and third (3B) base before returning home; reaching home earns a run, the point system for baseball. The pitcher’s objective is to prevent the hitter from returning home, referred to as getting the hitter “out,” either while the hitter is standing at home plate or while in the process of attempting to reach a base. The pitcher throws the ball towards home plate. The “strike zone” is a 3D space with the width and depth of home plate and a height determined by the height of the hitter. If the hitter does not swing, the pitch is called a “ball” if the pitch is received by the catcher outside the strike zone, or a “strike” if it is received inside the zone. If the hitter does swing, but fails to make contact with the ball, the pitch counts as a strike. If the hitter does make contact, but the ball lands outside the area between the basepaths (lines just wide of 1B and 3B, radiating from the batter’s boxes to the outfield walls), it is called “foul.” If the hitter has fewer than 2 strikes in the PA, fouls are counted as strikes, but foul balls that are not caught by the defense do not count as a third strike.

Ways in which a PA can end:

* If the PA reaches 3 strikes, the batter is out in what is deemed a “strikeout” (abbreviated as K).  
* If the PA reaches 4 balls, the batter advances to 1B in what is deemed a “walk” (abbreviated as BB).  
* If the ball hits the batter, they advance to 1B on a “hit by pitch” (HBP).  
* If the batter makes contact with the ball and it is caught before it touches the ground, the batter is out.  
* If the batter makes contact with the ball, it lands in fair territory, and the batter reaches 1B before a defender can step on 1B while holding the ball, the runner is safe and awarded a hit (H). If additional bases are not occupied by runners, the batter may choose to continue advancing; if so, a defender can get them out by touching them while holding the ball.  
* If the batter makes contact with the ball and it first touches ground beyond the outfield walls in fair territory (with the poles extending vertically from where the basepaths meet the wall counting as fair territory beyond the walls), they are awarded a home run (HR), where they and all runners on base come home to score.


Baserunning:  
No two baserunners can occupy the same base at the same time. If there is no unoccupied base behind the runner and a batted ball lands in fair territory, they are obligated to run to the next base. Such runners can be rendered out by a defender touching the base to which they are running while holding the ball. Multiple players can be rendered out in the same PA; for example, if a ball lands in fair territory with a runner on 1B, the ball can be thrown to defenders at 2B and then 1B (or vice versa) to render out the current batter and the runner starting at 1B.

If a ball is put in play and caught in the air by a defender, baserunners may still attempt to advance. If so, they must touch the base they currently occupy after the catch has been made before beginning their advance, and they can only be tagged out by a defender holding the ball. They can also attempt to advance before the active hitter makes contact with the ball; in this situation, they do not need to touch their current base before beginning to run, and they can only be tagged out. Successfully advancing in the latter situation is called “stealing a base” (SB), while getting tagged out in that scenario is deemed getting “caught stealing” (CS).

Game structure:  
Teams get turns at the plate in units called half-innings, which last for 3 outs. Earning the 3rd out is the only way in which a half-inning can end; unlike many other team sports, baseball does not operate on a clock that can run out to end an inning or game. Each inning comprises a “top” half-inning where the away team is on offense and the home team is on defense, and a “bottom” half-inning where the teams swap roles. There are 9 innings in a standard game of baseball. If the home team is leading after the top of the 9th, they are awarded a win without the bottom of the 9th being played (since the away team has run out of chances to score, and thus the outcome of the game has already been determined). If both teams are tied at the end of the 9th inning, additional “extra” innings are played until one team has the lead at the end of an inning. There are 9 hitters in each lineup, taking turns at the plate in an order that is fixed before the start of each game. 8 of these hitters are players serving non-pitcher defensive roles. Historically, the pitcher served as the 9th hitter, but since 1973 in MLB’s American League and 2022 for both leagues of MLB, it is a “designated hitter” who does not have a defensive role. Players can be brought into the lineup off the bench, replacing a specific hitter when it is that hitter’s turn at the plate; the player whose spot in the lineup is taken cannot be brought back into the game. Substitutions, with the same stipulation of being unable to return to the game after being substituted for, can also be made for players serving as baserunners or defenders (including pitchers).
