Glossary:

Terms are listed in their order of appearance in the notebooks, preceded by any other terms that first require definition.

PA (plate appearance): each instance of a hitter reaching their turn in the lineup and standing in the batterâ€™s box

K (strikeout): a PA ending with the hitter reaching 3 strikes, and thus out

BB (walk): a PA ending with the hitter reaching 4 balls, and thus awarded first base

HBP (hit-by-pitch): a PA where the hitter is hit by the pitch, and thus awarded first base

HR (home run): a PA where the hitter sends the ball past the outfield wall in fair territory, resulting in them and all runners on base scoring

AB (at-bat): a PA that ends in anything other than a BB or HBP

AVG (average, batting average): how frequently a player earns hits, H/AB

OBP (on-base percentage): how frequently a hitter reaches base safely, (H+BB+HBP)/PA

1B (single): a hit where the hitter ends up at first base (also abbreviated as 1B)

2B (double): a hit where the hitter ends up at second base (also abbreviated as 2B)

3B (triple): a hit where the hitter ends up at third base (also abbreviated as 3B)

XBH (extra-base hit): a hit that gets the runner past 1B (i.e. 2B, 3B, HR)

SLG: a metric that weights hits based on how many bases the runner earns with them; (1B \+ 2\*2B \+ 3\*3B \+ 4\*HR)/AB

ISO (isolated power): the portion of SLG that is determined by XBH as a metric for power, SLG \- AVG

SB (stolen base): when a runner advances on a pitch where the hitter does not make contact

WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched): the full name is self-explanatory; roughly the equivalent to OBP for a pitcher

BABIP (batting average on balls in play): how often a batter gets a hit on balls put in play (excluding HRs)

IP (innings pitched): the number of outs a pitcher gets divided by 3; if a pitcher starts an inning but does not record an out before being removed, it does not count towards their IP

R (run): the scoring unit of baseball, awarded when a hitter/runner advances to all 3 bases in the field and then returns home safely

ER (earned run): a run that is charged to a pitcher, where there were no errors by the defense that significantly affected the ability of the runner to ultimately score

ERA (earned run average): ER/IP, the traditional metric for judging how well a pitcher performs

FIP (fielder-independent pitching): a modern metric that only looks at outcomes that do not involve the defense (K, BB, HBP, HR)

wOBA (weighted on-base average): a formula that weights each outcome for a hitter/pitcher based on how much they contribute to scoring runs in that season

SF (sacrifice fly): a ball that is caught by a defender before it first touches the ground, allowing a runner on 3B to reach home before they can be tagged out

Ground ball, line drive, fly ball: while these terms do not have rigid definitions, ground balls are hit at a low angle and hit the ground fairly quickly; line drives are at a flatter/slightly elevated trajectory; and fly balls travel in an arc

Reliever: a pitcher brought in as a substitute

WAR (wins above replacement): a metric meant to distill the full contributions of a player into a single number, calculated in different ways by different sources
